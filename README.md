This project is a high-end digital catalog developed for a professional textile manufacturer. Unlike a standard e-commerce site, this platform focuses on high-quality product visualization and brand positioning. It was built as a freelance project to provide the client with a manageable, fast, and SEO-friendly way to showcase their textile collections (cushions, pillows, and fabrics) to B2B and B2C customers.

The site is fully production-ready and features a custom-built architecture to handle large product inventories through lightweight JSON data.

Technical Highlights
Dynamic Catalog Rendering: JavaScript-driven interface that pulls product data from JSON files, allowing for instant updates without changing the HTML structure.

Commercial SEO Suite: Fully optimized for search engines with custom meta-tags, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt to ensure the brand appears in industrial textile searches.

Image Performance: Optimized asset management with custom loaders (image-loader.js) to handle high-resolution product photography without sacrificing speed.

Scalable Data Architecture: Structured JSON system for inventory, including backup and price-management files for internal administrative use.

Production Hosting: Configured with .htaccess for clean URLs and professional server-side behavior.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5 & CSS3 (Advanced responsive layouts)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (Dynamic DOM manipulation)

Data Management: JSON (Inventory structure and backups)

Infrastructure: Apache (.htaccess), Google Search Console tools
